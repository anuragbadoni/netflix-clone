# Netflix Clone

This project was bootstrapped with made using the functionality of ReactJS along with integration of Firebase to make a clone of Netflix, a popular streaming website

## Stack

The following stack was used in this project:

### ReactJS

It acts as the basic javascript framework to integrate the necessary APIs and take care of server-side rendering

### Firebase

It acts as our storage system, utilising Firestore as well as our authentication system to provide user login signup functionality

### TailwindCSS

Styling vanilla css is pretty inconvenient, so we use Tailwind to build up a fluid and responsive frontend that is visually appealing
